# 1. The Original Visualization
For this DataViz Makeover assignment, I have used data from  Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS), which collects data of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market.

# 2. Critiques and suggestions for current visualisation

## 2.1 Clarity

### 1. No Graph Title
There's no title to indicate the content of this graph. As a viewer, it's not clear what is this graph about or what is the purpose of showing this graph. 

### 2. Overlapping Shapes
The bubbles shown in the graph are solid and overlapping, thus, viewers are not able to tell the exact Import / Export volumes of each country / region. 

### 3. Misleading Labels
The labels for each country / region are not aligned with their corresponding bubbles. Viewers may mistakenly read the numbers wrongly. 

### 4. Unclear Top Net Importer / Exporter Labels 
How Top Net Importer (Taiwan) and Top Net Exporter (Hong Kong) are calculated is unknown. Viewers are not sure the calculation is based on percentage or total amount.
